## Multi-Universe

This repository is a simulation just for fun of a small universe.
It includes an Universe object, with space-time object running in a thread 
(the time increases in lineal secuence, but the space increases with a small factor to
represents the dark energy expansion) and a random number of particles creates in a 
bigbang method.
