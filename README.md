# Multi-Universe

This repository is a simulation just for fun of a small universe. 
It includes an Universe object, with space-time object running in
 a thread (the time increases in linear sequence, but the space 
increases with a small (dummy) factor to represent the expansion by  dark
 energy) and a random number of particles created in a bigbang method.

### To do:

Simulate gravity force and apply it to particles in the universe.
